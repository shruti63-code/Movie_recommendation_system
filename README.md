ðŸŽ¬ Movie Recommendation System

This project implements a Movie Recommendation System using Collaborative Filtering in Python. It uses the MovieLens-style dataset (movies.csv and ratings.csv) to recommend movies to users based on similar users' preferences.

ðŸ“Œ Features

Collaborative Filtering (User-User Similarity using cosine similarity).

Recommends movies to a user based on ratings from similar users.

Works with movies.csv and ratings.csv datasets.

Simple, lightweight, and runs in Google Colab (Python 3 runtime).

ðŸ“‚ Dataset

movies.csv â†’ Contains movieId, title, and genres.

ratings.csv â†’ Contains userId, movieId, rating.

Example:

movies.csv

movieId,title,genres
1,Toy Story (1995),Adventure|Animation|Children|Comedy|Fantasy
2,Jumanji (1995),Adventure|Children|Fantasy
3,Grumpier Old Men (1995),Comedy|Romance


ratings.csv

userId,movieId,rating
1,1,4.0
1,3,3.5
2,1,5.0
2,2,4.5
3,2,4.0

ðŸš€ Installation & Setup

Open Google Colab and create a new Python 3 notebook.

Upload the dataset files (movies.csv and ratings.csv).

Copy and paste the code from this repo into your notebook.

Run the notebook to generate recommendations.

ðŸ§  How It Works

Load and merge movies and ratings datasets.

Create a User-Movie Rating Matrix.

Compute Cosine Similarity between users.

For a target user:

Find similar users.

Aggregate ratings from similar users (weighted by similarity).

Recommend top movies the target user hasnâ€™t rated yet.

ðŸ“Š Example Output
Top movie recommendations for User 1:
Jumanji (1995)                 8.75
Grumpier Old Men (1995)        6.30
Toy Story (1995)               5.90
